	<h1>What is happening to the environment?</h1>
	
	<p>-The Younger Dryas event (12,800 to 11,600 years ago) is the most intensely studied and best-understood example of abrupt climate change.
The event took place during the last deglaciation, a period of global warming when the Earth system was in transition from a glacial mode to an interglacial one. The Younger Dryas was marked by a sharp drop in temperatures in the North Atlantic region; cooling in northern Europe and eastern North America is estimated at 4 to 8 °C (7.2 to 14.4 °F). 
A 200-year-long cooling event in the Northern Hemisphere approximately 8,200 years ago resulted from the rapid draining of glacial Lake Agassiz into the North Atlantic via the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence drainage.

<h1> Main Causes: </h1>
<ul class= "facts">
 <li>Water vapor increases as the Earth's atmosphere warms, but so does the possibility of clouds and precipitation, making these some of the most important feedback mechanisms to the greenhouse effect. </li>
 <li>Carbon dioxide is released through natural processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions and through human activities such as deforestation, land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by more than a third since the Industrial Revolution began. This is the most important long-lived "forcing" of climate change. </li>
</ul>

<h1> Some Effects: </h1>
<ul class="effects">
<li>Warmer conditions will probably lead to more evaporation and precipitation overall, but individual regions will vary, some becoming wetter and others dryer.</li>
<li>A stronger greenhouse effect will warm the oceans and partially melt glaciers and other ice, increasing sea level. </li>
<li>some crops and other plants may respond favorably to increased atmospheric CO2, growing more vigorously and using water more efficiently. At the same time, higher temperatures and shifting climate patterns may change the areas where crops grow best and affect the makeup of natural plant communities.</li>
</ul>
