	<h1>How is it affecting us? </h1>
<p>All these effects make it unpleasant and eventually impossible for humans and other organisms to live on Earth. Countries closer to the equator already experience high heat temperatures closer to our bodies biophysical thresholds so that incremental rises in temperature are much more dangerous. Heat also increases the rise in transmission and incidence of airborne and waterborne diseases in the tropics generating unpayable health costs as the majority of the worlds poorest people do not have health insurance coverage or access to financial products and services. Many hundreds of thousands have already died from the worsening floods, droughts, heat-waves, cyclones and disease that global warming is unleashing. The death-toll is predicted to rise to millions in just a few decades. Nearly all these climate change casualties and those most at risk, are poor people living in the Majority World.
