	<h1>What is climate change?</h1>
	<ul class="info">
	<li>Climate change occurs when changes in Earth's climate system result in new weather patterns that remain in place for an extended period of time. In this case, global warmig is catching up to us due to the amount of human beings who do not care about trashing their environment.</li>
	<li>Climate change can alter where species live, how they interact, and the timing of biological events, which could fundamentally transform current ecosystems and food webs.</li>
	<li>It can overwhelm the capacity of ecosystems to shift to extreme scenarios, such as wildfires, floods, and dorughts. </li>
</ul>
	<h1> What can be done?</h1>
	
	<ul class="action">
	<li>Reduce Water Waste</li>
	<li>Recycle Plastics,Glass, and other reusable products </li>
	<li>Use less electricity</li>
	<li>Approximately 10 percent of U.S. energy use goes into growing, processing, packaging, and shipping food, about 40 percent of which just winds up in the landfill. So actually eat the food you buy.</li>
	<li> Better yet, Speak Up!</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h1>What do I want to achieve?</h1>
	<div>
	<h3> I would like for climate change to be spread more, as it is not a topic many talk about. It is a very dangerous issue that affects everyone in the world, yet nothing is being done. We can all spread awareness and do the most a person can to help our environment. Let's be the change in this new generation.</h3>
